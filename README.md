AutoHotKey Retrobat Theme Randomizer
Version 1.0
David Marti

====================================================================

This script is for launching Retrobat and have it randomly load with a
different installed theme.

The script will read all of the directory names in the themes folder and randomly
choose one to use.

It dynamically updates the es_settings.cfg file with the new chosen theme name.

====================================================================

Compile:

To compile the exe file you must have AutoHotKey installed.

Once it is installed, within Windows Explorer, simply right click on the
start_retrobat_random.ahk file and choose Compile from the pop-up menu.

This will create the start_retrobat_random.exe file.

====================================================================

Usage:

Place the compiled start_retrobat_random.exe file into the same folder as the
existing retrobat.exe file.

Double click on the start_retrobat_random.exe file to start Retrobat.
